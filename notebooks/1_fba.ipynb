    "Quite often, one wants to make small changes to a model and evaluate the impacts of these. For example, we may want to knock-out all reactions sequentially, and see what the impact of this is on the objective function. One way of doing this would be to create a new copy of the model before each knock-out with model.copy(). However, even with small models, this is a very slow approach as models are quite complex objects. Better then would be to do the knock-out, optimizing and then manually resetting the reaction bounds before proceeding with the next reaction. Since this is such a common scenario however, cobrapy allows us to use the model as a context, to have changes reverted automatically."
