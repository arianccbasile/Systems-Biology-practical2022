# Systems-Biology-practical2022

Practical exercises for the computational session on microbial community modeling.

In the folder called notebooks you will find everything you need for these practical exercises. Each tutorial is uploaded as html and ipynb files so if you edit something from the ipynb you still have the original text in the html. Also the results to the exercises are in the html files.
