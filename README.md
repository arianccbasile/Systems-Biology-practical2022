# ü¶† Systems Biology FBA Practical üß¨

## üìú About

This repo hosts training materials for the University of Cambridge [Part III Systems Biology course](https://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/Part%20III). More specifically, these are practical exercises for the computational session on flux balance analysis (FBA) using genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You will find everything you need for these practical exercises under the `/notebooks` folder. Each tutorial is uploaded as `.html` and `.ipynb` files, so as you edit the python notebooks you will still have the original text and results in the html files. 

### Running locally

You may run these exercises on your local machine by cloning this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/systems-biology-fba-practical.git
```

Navigate into cloned repo folder:

```
$ cd systems-biology-fba-practical
```

Launch interactive jupyter notebook session:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```
