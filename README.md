## üìú About

This repo hosts training materials for the University of Cambridge [Part III Systems Biology course](https://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/Part%20III). More specifically, these are practical exercises for the computational session on flux balance analysis (FBA) using genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). Most of the exercises are based on the [cobrapy documentation](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Learning outcomes

#### [Exercise 1](https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/systems-biology-fba-practical/blob/main/notebooks/1_fba.md)
- **1.1**: Import a metabolic reconstruction
- **1.2**: Inspect the reactions of your model
- **1.3**: Inspect the metabolites in your model
- **1.4**: Inspect the genes in your model
- **1.4.1**: Perform in-silico gene knockout experiments

#### [Exercise 2](https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/systems-biology-fba-practical/blob/main/notebooks/2_fba.md)
- **2.1**: Modify growth medium of your reconstruction
- **2.2**: Perform gene essentiality analysis under different conditions
- **2.3**: Case study, simulate the Carbtree effect in yeast

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You will find everything you need for these practical exercises under the `/notebooks` folder. Each tutorial is uploaded as `.html`, `.md`, `.tex`, and `.ipynb` files. Therefore, ss you edit the python notebooks, you will still have the original text and results available in the html, markdown, and latex files. 

### Running locally

You may run these exercises on your local machine by cloning this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/systems-biology-fba-practical.git
```

Navigate into cloned repo folder:

```
$ cd systems-biology-fba-practical
```

Launch interactive jupyter notebook session:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This should launch a browser window, where you can click on the `/notebooks` folder and start the exercises.

### Running on the cloud
